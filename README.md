# Object-RE-ID
Object re identification is meant to play an important role in real world industrial applications. Out of them it can be applied in fisheries science as well. To count the individuals or track specific individual fish across time and space gives so much capability to monitor and analyze individual behaviour as well as other important aspects. FOr example in fisheries technology, its important to keep track or count the correct number of individuals that are entering a fishing gear, especiallt an active fishing gear like trawls. sometimes fish flow with the movement of the gear or some fish keep coming back. If we use an underwater camera for this observations, it is quiet confusing to have these individuals appearing and reappearing to the frames in different times. So it is important to develop models that can maintain the track of each individuals while keeping the accuracy and efficiency. This project will consist of several steps.

#Steps in the project
1. Identifying and understanding the data structure and annotations of the Autofish dataset
